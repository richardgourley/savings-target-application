# savings-target-application
This is a simple app for Javascript students to practice see some key skills in action. The app allows a user to enter a savings target, hit a button and then see how much they would need to save every month to hit their target in various time frames.

- I have included a basic html sheet with the project.

SKILLS USED:
- functions
- addEventListener()
- data validation - isNaN()
- if statements
- string concatenation
- arrays
- for loops

EXTRA CHALLENGES:
If you are fairly new to Javascript, take it further by:
- Allow users to change currency!
- Allow users to add, remove month lengths for longer or shorter saving periods.

If you are an intermediate level Javascript student, just for practice rather than performance, see if you could re-write some of the app with:
- Recursion
- A for...of loop
- Closures
