# savings-target-application
A simple app for Javascript students that allows a user to enter a savings target, hit a button and then view various lengths of time showing the user how long it would take to hit their savings target, and how much they would need to save every month.

- I have included a basic html and css style sheet with the project.

- This a simple exercise designed to help students new to Javascript.  It can also be helpful to students in understanding how they should perform calculations and format numbers for financial applications.

- I will add a list here of the Javascript skills used in the application, when it is complete and tested!
